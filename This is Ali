# Ali Mostafa - UX Designer & Junior Flutter Developer

## About Me

Hello, I'm Ali Mostafa, and I'm a passionate designer on a unique journey. While my formal education led me through the civil engineering department at Cairo University, my true passion lies in crafting digital experiences. During my time there, I actively engaged in various student activities, initially drawn to graphic design. As I collaborated with talented peers, my interest expanded into the realms of marketing and user-centric design.

My journey took a decisive turn when my team conceptualized a mobile application. Curiosity drove me to dive into the world of UX/UI design, and I was captivated. Post-graduation, I pivoted my career, immersing myself in the fundamentals of UX Design at Mahara-Tech. I further honed my skills through Udacity's Advanced UX Design Nano-Degree, all while translating theory into practice.

Beside my UX design expertise, I've also embraced the world of Flutter app development. I've earned Flutter certificates from Coursera and Udemy courses, and you can find some of my projects right here on my GitHub. As a junior Flutter developer and a UX designer, I'm dedicated to continuous growth, expanding my expertise, and crafting meaningful user experiences.
